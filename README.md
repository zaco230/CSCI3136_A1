# CSCI3136_A1

•	Every group member must create the submission folder (a1, a2, ...) and place a file GROUP.txt in it.

•	The GROUP.txt file must contain the CSIDs of all group members, one ID per line.  Do not place email addresses or full names into the file.  List only the CSIDs.  The management scripts at my end parse this file to associate the submissions by different students with each other.

•	At least one group member submits the assignment solution in their submission folder (a1, a2, ...).

•	Ideally, make sure that exactly one group member submits the solution because this avoids ambiguities.  If multiple group members submit the solution, make sure that all of you submit the exact same solution.  Otherwise, my scripts will detect that the submissions differ and I will have to confirm which submission I should use for grading.

•	Once the assignment is marked, the marks will be shared with all group members by placing one or multiple MARKS.*.txt files into each group member's submission folder.
